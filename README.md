# Income Manager Project

This is a project for Data Structure class, by building a personal income manager that makes percentage distributions on 3 main categories: Needs, Personal, and Investments.
With a GUI, the user can enter their income for a specific date and choose each category percentage to be distributed and saved to a csv file for entry history.
